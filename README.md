# Open Stream Overlays
A lightning fast, locally hosted, open source overlay system for live streamers 

### Welcome to OSO
OSO is an overlay system for live streamers built using Bun, Typescript and React. The Goal of OSO is to provide an alternative to the proprietary cloud-based systems that streamers currently use and provide an even more flexible system for creating custom overlay elements.

### Progress
OSO is still in very early development, this readme will be updated when OSO begins introducing usable overlays.
